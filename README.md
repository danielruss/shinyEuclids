A cloud4bio exercise in Shiny

Thank you [RStudio](https://RStudio.com) for provide a space in the cloud for shiny apps.  As part of a [cloud4bio](https://cloud4bio.github.io/) exercise, 
I wrote code that accepts a csv file using 
the rows as vectors of data and calculate the mean distance between all the rows.

I chose to use R to solve the problem and use shiny to deliver the solution as a customer facing app.  My code is in the repository.
You can [run it live](https://dan-russ.shinyapps.io/Shiny2/) on shinyapps.io.  If you need online data try it with the iris data.  You can use the copy in our github repository `https://episphere.github.io/qaqc/iris.csv`

Are you interested in learning more about R shiny?  RStudio has a [fanstastic 2.5 hour recorded tutorial on how to develop shiny apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).
They have links to various parts of the tutorial so you can watch it in parts.

Have fun and use R.
